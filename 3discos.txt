Canadian Goose
I woke up in the morning, brush my teeth smack my bitch ass
All I do is think about the cash
Yeah, what, getting all this cash
Yeah, what, I'm 200 on the dash
Lil Uzi ooh, I got hella groupies
Smoking Backwoods I don't fuck with doobies
Cuffed the double plus 'cause I'm rocking Ksubi's
I fuck with my same hoes I don't trust these niggas
990 that's the nubies ya
Smoked that boy like he is a loosie ya
On the Xan, hear a noise I load it up

All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us
Literally I'm cold as fuck
I need Canadian Goose
I need to get a Moncler
Diamonds so cold need some soup

Driving around in a what
Saint Laurent all on my boots
Saint Laurent all on my boo

All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us
Literally I'm cold as fuck
I need Canadian Goose
I need to get a Moncler
Diamonds so cold need some soup

Diamonds all on my teeth so I barely can talk
Money all in my pockets so I barely can walk
Diamonds they shine in the dark
She from LA but she live in New York
But I ain't worried about that
Worried about busting them traps
Lil Uzi ya you know I be smoking that pack
If she gon' leave then you know she coming right back
In a Cadillac do a drive by with a Mac
When I walk in none of these hoes can relax
When I walk in know that I move with the racks
When I walk in know that I move with the racks
Came right in put my city on my back
But I'm still so relaxed on a Xanax
I don't care what you did, don't love you less
But it's still Margiela all on my vest
What a cross on my neck
I just flew to the A
I might go to MIA
I ain't talking paper planes
On the block with all my chains
Got the money and the fame
You a lame that's a shame

All these diamonds ain't nobody cold as us
Literally I'm cold as fuck
I need Canadian Goose
I need to get a Moncler
Diamonds so cold need some soup

She's sipping Moet, and yeah, I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No, I'm not a rat, but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie, she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone, you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
Hello, I was listening to this song
It goes like

I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only, only trying to show you things
Iced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring
I had to get a me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii, looking at the ring
She smiling happy, but I'm laughing, 'cause her man a lame
(Broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi)
That just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (real shit)
Stuck to the plan, even though you used to go with my mans
Oh, get over it

I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
And I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

I tied up my RAF, you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Compliment my style
She don't want me, I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me, then I'ma let her
Go over there with that broke fella
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather
My new chick, I swear that she better
Want me back, never (ooh)

That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah, I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No, I'm not a rat, but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie, she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone, you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it (woah)
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it (you'll get over it)
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it (no, no)
